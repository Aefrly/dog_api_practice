# Dog API

This is a simple web application for you to practice using `.fetch()` to send an API request to the [Dog API](https://kinduff.github.io/dog-api/) and render the returned data in the DOM. For the practice, use the following endpoint to get a random fact about a dog

```bash
https://dogapi.dog/api/facts
```

You can then use `.fetch()` to send the API request. Once the request is sent, use `async`/`await` or `.fetch()` to get the data once the Promise is resolved.
